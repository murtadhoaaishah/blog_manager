Architecture & Design Decisions
Component Structure
Separation of Concerns: Components are separated by functionality (forms, lists, cards)
Props Interface: Clear TypeScript interfaces for all component props
State Management
React Hooks: All state is managed locally in the main App component
API Integration
Service Layer: Abstracted API calls into a separate service layer
JSONPlaceholder: Using JSONPlaceholder as the mock API
Important Note: JSONPlaceholder is a fake API - POST/PUT/DELETE operations appear to work but don't persist on the server. The application manages state locally after API calls to simulate persistence.
Form Validation
Client-side Validation: Built-in validation for all form fields
Real-time Feedback: Error messages displayed immediately
Validation Rules:
Title: Required, minimum 5 characters
Content: Required, minimum 20 characters
Author: Required
Category: Required
Search & Filter Implementation
Case-insensitive Search: Search works on both title and content fields
Dynamic Categories: Categories are automatically extracted from posts
Combined Filtering: Search and category filter work together
Performance: Uses useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations
Error Handling
Try-Catch Blocks: All async operations wrapped in error handling
User Feedback: Clear error messages with retry options
Loading States: Visual indicators during API calls
🎨 UI/UX Features
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
Loading Spinners: Visual feedback during data fetching
Empty States: Helpful messages when no data is available
Hover Effects: Interactive elements have clear hover states
Focus States: Proper focus indicators for accessibility
Color Coding: Different colors for edit (blue) and delete (red) actions
🔍 Key Features Explained
Search Functionality
The search feature filters posts in real-time as you type, searching through both the title and content of posts. The search is case-insensitive for better user experience.

Category Filter
Categories are dynamically generated from the posts. Users can filter by a specific category or view all posts. The filter works in combination with the search feature.
